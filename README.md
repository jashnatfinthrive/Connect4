## Technologies Used
#### Blazor WebAssembly: 
This project is a demonstration of the capabilities of Blazor WebAssembly. Blazor WebAssembly is a single-page app framework for building interactive client-side web apps with .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor WebAssembly runs on the client in the web browser using WebAssembly.
This project serves as a practical example of Blazor WebAssembly in action and can be a valuable resource for those learning about the framework. Contributions to improve this project are welcome!
